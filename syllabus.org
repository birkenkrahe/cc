** About reading the book / further studies

I've looked at a lot of books and videos when preparing the first
version of this course, in spring 2022. The book by King is head
and shoulders above most of them, even more recent ones. Two
sources come close - Head First C (Griffiths, 2012), and the Udemy
course by Collingbourne (2021).

However, nothing can replace reading and re-reading the book by
King itself. When preparing for this summer course, I took a couple
of weeks to work through every Q&A and every exercise and program
assignment of the book's chapters 1-13 on which this course is
based. I'm happy to share my Emacs Org-mode notebooks with you.

** Objectives

This course introduces you to system programming using C. We cover
C++ as an extension. System programming is pure power: it enables
you to converse with the computer at a level unknown to users of
Python or other high level languages. You also learn about:
compilers, working on the command line, text editors like vi and
Emacs, using C for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, cybersecurity,
and using UML. You get a foundation in computational, critical
thinking in concert with one of the three most popular languages
(the other two are Python and Java).  We will endeavour to cover
most of chapters 1-15 of the textbook by King.

** Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete CSC 100.01 "Introduction to programming in
C/C++", will be able to:

- Master basic sequential programming skills (conditional
  statements, loops, functions, input/output, use of data types)
- Explain the basic components of a procedural programming language
- Apply the basics of programming to solve a variety of
  quantitative problems
- Master computing infrastructure (compiler, editor, shell)
- Know how to effectively present assignment results

** Course requirements

No prior knowledge required. Some knowledge of, and experience with
computers is useful but not critical. Curiosity is essential. You
will gain data literacy skills by taking this course. The course
will prepare you for further studies in computer and data science,
or in other disciplines that use modern computing, i.e. every
discipline, from accounting to zoology).

** Grading system

| DESCRIPTION             | IMPACT |
|-------------------------+--------|
| Quizzes                 |    10% |
| Class assignments       |    30% |
| Programming assignments |    30% |
| Final exam              |    30% |

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Schoology gradebook for the course.

*** Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter
grades. For the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs,
while for the term results, only straight letters are given (by
rounding up).

|--------+-----------------+---------------|
|    *%* | *Midterm Grade* | *Final Grade* |
|--------+-----------------+---------------|
| 100-98 | A+              |               |
|  97-96 | A               | A (passed -   |
|  95-90 | A-              | very good)    |
|--------+-----------------+---------------|
|  89-86 | B+              |               |
|  85-80 | B               | B (passed -   |

* Standard Policies
** Honor Code

All graded work in this class is to be pledged in accordance with
the Lyon College Honor Code. The use of a phone for any reason
during the course of an exam is considered an honor code
violation.

** Class Attendance Policy

Students are expected to attend all class periods for the courses
in which they are enrolled. They are responsible for conferring
with individual professors regarding any missed
assignments. Faculty members are to notify the Registrar when a
student misses the equivalent of one, two, three, and four weeks
of class periods in a single course. Under this policy, there is
no distinction between “excused” and “unexcused” absences, except
that a student may make up work missed during an excused
absence. A reminder of the college’s attendance policy will be
issued to the student at one week, a second reminder at two weeks,
a warning at three weeks, and notification of administrative
withdrawal and the assigning of an “F” grade at four
weeks. Students who are administratively withdrawn from more than
one course will be placed on probation or suspended.

** Disabilities

Students seeking reasonable accommodations based on documented
learning disabilities must contact Interim Director of Academic
Support Courtney Beal in the Morrow Academic Center at (870)
307-7016 or at courtney.beal@lyon.edu.

** Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct

Title IX and Lyon’s policy prohibit harassment, discrimination and
sexual misconduct. Lyon encourages anyone experiencing harassment,
discrimination or sexual misconduct to talk to Danell Hetrick,
Title IX Coordinator and Interim Vice-President for Student Life,
or Sh’Nita Mitchell, Title IX Investigator and Associate Dean for
Students, about what happened so they can get the support they need
and Lyon can respond appropriately.  Lyon is legally obligated to
respond to reports of sexual misconduct, and therefore we cannot
guarantee the confidentiality of a report, unless made to a
confidential resource (Chaplain, Counselor, or Nurse). As a faculty
member, I am required to report possible Title IX violations and
must provide our Title IX coordinator with all relevant details.  I
cannot, therefore, guarantee confidentiality.

** Details

Details specific to this course may be found in the subsequent
pages of this syllabus. Those details will include at least the
following:
- A description of the course consistent with the Lyon College catalog.
- A list of student learning outcomes for the course.
- A summary of all course requirements.
- An explanation of the grading system to be used in the course.
- Any course-specific attendance policies that go beyond the
  College policy.
- Details about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable
  student collaboration on graded work.

* Course specific information
** Assignments and Honor Code

There will be several assignments during the summer school,
including programming assignments and multiple-choice tests. They
are due at the beginning of the class period on the due date. Once
class begins, the assigment will be considered one day late if it
has not been turned in.  Late programs will not be accepted without
an extension. Extensions will *not* be granted for reasons such as:

- You could not get to a computer
- You could not get a computer to do what you wanted it to do
- The network was down
- The printer was out of paper or toner
- You erased your files, lost your homework, or misplaced your
  flash drive
- You had other coursework or family commitments that interfered
  with your work in this course

  Put “Pledged” and a note of any collaboration in the comments of
  any program you turn in. Programming assignments are individual
  efforts, but you may seek assistance from another student or the
  course instructor.  You may not copy someone else’s solution. If
  you are having trouble finishing an assignment, it is far better to
  do your own work and receive a low score than to go through an
  honor trial and suffer the penalties that may be involved.

  What is cheating on an assignment? Here are a few examples:

  - Having someone else write your assignment, in whole or in part
  - Copying an assignment someone else wrote, in whole or in part
  - Collaborating with someone else to the extent that your
    submissions are identifiably very similar, in whole or in part
  - Turning in a submission with the wrong name on it

    What is not cheating?  Here are some examples:

    - Talking to someone in general terms about concepts involved in an
      assignment
    - Asking someone for help with a specific error message or bug in
      your program
    - Getting help with the specifics of language syntax or citation
      style
    - Utilizing information given to you by the instructor

    Any assistance must be clearly explained in the comments at the
    beginning of your submission.  If you have any questions about
    this, please ask or review the policies relating to the Honor Code.

    Absences on Days of Exams:

    Test “make-ups” will only be allowed if arrangements have been made
    prior to the scheduled time.  If you are sick the day of the test,
    please e-mail me or leave a message on my phone before the
    scheduled time, and we can make arrangements when you return.

** Attendance policy

You must attend a minimum of 75% of non-cancelled meetings - you are
allowed to miss *5 classes* over the whole summer school duration (or 1
class per week) without risking a fail.
