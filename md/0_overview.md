# My first programming languages

![img](../img/0_ti99.jpg "Texas Instruments TI-99/4 16-bit microcomputer, 1979")

-   My first programming languages:
    1.  BASIC - Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (1979)
    2.  FORTRAN - FORMula TRANslator (1985)
    3.  C++ (1989)

# The importance of infrastructure

![img](../img/0_infrastructure.jpg "Layers between you and a document on your computer")

The image shows eight layers that your computing infrastructure has to
manage (there are more in fact) - most of the software enabling you to
do this (without you noticing) is written in C.

# What do you expect from this course?

![img](../img/0_expectations.jpg "Dandelion in the grass, by Aaron Burden, @Unsplash")

-   I would like to make a website
-   I want to learn as many languages as I can
-   I may need it (formally) for my Math major
-   I want to make video games
-   I want to get better at computing because of math/eng
-   I want to become a software developer
-   I want to see if computing may be in my future

# What careers do our students have?

<a id="orge9d1137"></a>

# What will you do in this course?

![img](../img/0_schedule.png "Syllabus, Canvas (lyon.instructure.com) or GitHub (github.com/birkenkrahe/ds2)")

-   We have a **textbook** - King, C Programming - A modern approach (2008)
-   We have an **operating system** - Linux (maybe) or Windows/MacOS
-   We have (more than) an **editor** - Emacs + Org-mode
-   We have a **compiler** - GCC ([also on a Mac](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/cc/piHome/img/0_gcc_mac.png))


<a id="org03239ba"></a>

# GCC installation on MacOS

The following two answers came from ChatGPT, a conversational machine
learning model created by OpenAI.

# How will you be evaluated?

![img](../img/0_grades.png "Source: syllabus, Canvas (lyon.instructure.com) or GitHub (github.com/birkenkrahe/ml)")

-   All course requirements have deadlines
-   Late submissions will be penalized (loss of points)
-   Final exam will be sourced by term test questions
-   Programming assignments are home assignments
-   In-class practices are "literate programming" exercises


<a id="org9524da3"></a>

# Which tools are you going to use?

![img](../img/0_tools.jpg "Unsplash, workshop")

-   [Canvas](https://lyon.instructure.com/) (learning management system)

-   [GitHub repository](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc) (all course materials except tests)

-   [GNU Emacs](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org) (literate programming environment)

-   [Command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) / interpreter - (shell / replit.com)<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

# The (new) Canvas LMS

![img](../img/0_canvas.png "Canvas")

-   Announcements
-   Assignments (Programming assignments and in-class practice)
-   Zoom links (participate/cloud recording)

# The (popular) GitHub platform

![img](../img/0_github.png "My GitHub dashboard - close to 4,000 commits in 2022 (100,000 lines of code?)")

-   [GitHub](https://github.com/birkenkrahe) is the most popular software development platform.

-   It's now owned by Microsoft (which is becoming a problem)

-   Here for you: all course materials, and the course FAQ

# The (feared) Emacs editor

# DONE Practice: first "literate" C program!

![img](../img/0_books.png "Books aren't the only way to be "literate" in programming!")

(You can find a [PDF of this exercise](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc/blob/piHome/pdf/first_org_print.pdf) on GitHub)

Let's set Emacs up, write and run a first "literate" C program!

1.  Open the command line terminal with `CMD` in the search field

2.  At the prompt, type `gcc --version`

3.  Open <https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/> in a browser

4.  Navigate to the repository `emacs` in GitHub

5.  Click on the file name `.emacs` to open it

6.  Open the `Raw` version of this file (there's a button)

7.  Right click to `Save as` and save file as `emacs.txt` in `/Downloads`

8.  Open a terminal by entering `CMD` in the Windows search bar

9.  Pin the terminal to your taskbar

10. At the prompt, enter `DIR emacs.txt` - you should see the file

11. At the prompt, enter `emacs --version`

12. Enter `emacs -nw -l emacs.txt`

13. Inside Emacs, click `<F10>` and `ENTER` to open a new file

14. At the prompt at the bottom of the screen, enter `first.org`

15. Enter the following text (replace `yourname` with your own name):
    
    ![img](../img/0_first.png)

16. Run the program by putting the cursor anywhere on the code block
    and typing `CTRL-c CTRL-c` (or `C-c C-c`)

17. Tangle the code with `C-c C-v t` (or `M-x org-babel-tangle`)
    
    ![img](../img/0_litprog1.png "What happens when you tangle or weave a literate program")

18. Open a shell (terminal program) with `ALT-x eshell`

19. At the prompt, enter `ls -l first*` - you should see `first.C`

20. Enter `gcc first.C -o hello`

21. Enter `hello` to run the program.

22. Upload `first.org` as your first in-class assignment [to Canvas!](https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1041/assignments/5889)

# When is the first assignment due?

![img](../img/0_monks.png "Four monks by Claudio Rinaldi (1852-1909)")

-   The first in-class assignment (`first.org`, see Canvas) is due on
    Friday, January 27. For late submissions, you lose 1 point per day
    (out of 10 possible points)

-   The first home assignment (`Emacs tutorial`, see Canvas) is due on
    Monday, January 27. For late submissions, you lose 1 point per day
    (out of 10 possible points)

-   We'll write the first weekly multiple-choice test on January 23,
    covering all of the material that was covered until then.
