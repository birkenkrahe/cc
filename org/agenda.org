- *Scalability:* when you want to go from 10 customers to 1,000,000

- *Reliability:* systems must be available and performant when needed

- *Security:* protect against unauthorized access and cyberthreats

- *Adaptability:* businesses must adapt quickly to stay competitive

- *Changeability:* IT changes faster than most other technologies

** What is meta data?

#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Org-mode file with hidden meta data

*Meta data is data that describes other data.* It provides information
about the characteristics of other data, such as its content, format,
and structure. Meta data can be used to describe many different types
of data, including files, images, videos, documents, and databases.

** What is a compiler (e.g. GCC)?

[[../img/compiler.png]]

- A compiler is a type of program that takes *source code* written in a
  high-level programming language and converts it into *machine code*.

- Machine code can be executed directly by a computer's central
  processing unit (CPU).

- The machine code produced by a compiler is specific to the
  architecture of the computer it is being run on.

* TODO (Home) Assignment: Emacs tutorial (due Jan 20)
#+attr_latex: :width 300px
[[../img/0_gnuemacs.png]]

- We're going to begin this assignment together in class - but you may
  need to finish it at home (or in the MAC or in one of the computer
  labs, Lyon 104 or Derby 209) on your own.

- To install Emacs on your computer, follow the instructions in the
  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][GitHub FAQ]]. When you're at it, you should also install a C compiler.

- If you have trouble installing anything on your own computer, bring
  it to class or come to my office hours (Mon-Fri, 4.15-4.45 PM).

- Open the Tutorial [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc/blob/piHome/org/tutorial.org][in GitHub]] and follow the instructions:
  [[https://tinyurl.com/3j5ddtuk][tinyurl.com/3j5ddtuk]]
  
- There is also a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc/blob/piHome/pdf/tutorial.pdf][PDF version]] if you like to print things out.

- When you've completed the instructions, you should have a
  time-stamped Org-mode file that you can [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1014/assignments/6479][upload to Canvas]].

* TODO REPL demo @replit.com

[fn:1]"The Dunning-Kruger effect was first discovered and written
about in 1999, by researchers David Dunning and Justin Kruger at
Cornell University. The researchers spotted how much people
overestimated their own abilities in daily life—think of the guy in
class who keeps raising his hand to relay his useless ideas—and coined
the term “dual burden”. Dual burden was used to describe that these
people suffer from two things: ignorance, and ignorance of their own
ignorance. The researchers tested random participants on tests of
humour, grammar, and logical reasoning. They found that people who
ranked in the bottom 25% of any of these test scores tended to predict
themselves to be at the top of the pack. When they scored in the 12th
percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. On the flip
side, people in the top 25% predicted their scores to be slightly
lower than they actually were." (Source: [[https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect][thedecisionlab.com]])
