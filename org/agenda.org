- *Scalability:* when you want to go from 10 customers to 1,000,000

- *Reliability:* systems must be available and performant when needed

- *Security:* protect against unauthorized access and cyberthreats

- *Adaptability:* businesses must adapt quickly to stay competitive

- *Changeability:* IT changes faster than most other technologies

** What is meta data?

*Meta data is data that describes other data.* It provides information
about the characteristics of other data, such as its content, format,
and structure. Meta data can be used to describe many different types
of data, including files, images, videos, documents, and databases.

** What is a compiler (e.g. GCC)?

- A compiler is a type of program that takes *source code* written in a
  high-level programming language and converts it into *machine code*.

- Machine code can be executed directly by a computer's central
  processing unit (CPU).

- The machine code produced by a compiler is specific to the
  architecture of the computer it is being run on.

* TODO Assignment: Emacs tutorial (due Jan 23)

1) Open Emacs from the terminal application with ~emacs -nw~

2) For the full experiemce, open the Emacs tutorial (link on start
   page, or ~C-h t~). In class, we're going to start your home
   assignment with a self-made tutorial, 
   #+attr_latex: :width 400px
   [[../img/gnuemacs2.png]]

3) Complete the Emacs tutorial (start in class):
   1) Basic navigation up/down/left/right/top/bottom (ca. 25%)
   2) Exit/quit/undo steps
   3) Inserting/deleting/killing/yanking
   4) Finding/saving files
   5) Listing/selecting/deleting buffers
   6) Auto-saving/echo area/mode line
   7) Searching up and down in a text
   8) Open/close/divide/change windows
   9) Getting more help
   10) Write, time-stamp and upload completed file
   
4) You do not have to remember most of the information now but you
   have to try all commands offered to you. 

5) Insert these two lines at the top of the buffer:
   #+begin_example
     STUDENT: YourName [PLEDGED]
     Time-stamp: <>
   #+end_example

6) Remember that *"Pledged"* means that you have actually completed the
   tutorial along the lines of the instructions and in good faith as
   laid out in the [[https://catalog.lyon.edu/the-lyon-college-honor-pledge][Lyon College Honor Pledge]].
    
7) While visiting the buffer, insert a time stamp with the command ~M-x
   time-stamp~. Save the file with ~C-x C-w~ as a file ~tutorial.txt~ file
   and submit it in Canvas. The top of the submission should look like
   this (with your name and your time stamp, not mine - the added text
   was marked in red by me):

* TODO Review and explanations: Emacs tutorial

- [L68] If you inadvertently used the mouse, your terminal display may
  be messed up. Simply type ~C-l~ to re-center the screen and fix the
  terminal. You only have to use your mouse if you want to leave Emacs.
  
- [L4] "Key bindings": Emacs users favor the keyboard. Translating the
  keys to a keyboard is fixed in the keymap. In Emacs, you can change
  the association of all keys to all commands freely. CTRL (~C-~) and
  META or ALT (~M-~) keys are standard on most keyboards. On MacOS, you
  may have to experiment a little to find the right keys.

- [L115] "Newline character": you've seen this in your first C inside
  the ~printf~ function: ~printf("hello world\n");~ - the ~\n~ is this
  character, also called an "escape character" because it does not
  lead to printing but to carriage return (go to next line).

- [L130] "Scrolling": when the screen is automatically moved up as you
  scroll down with the cursor.

- [L206] Do not use the arrow keys but learn the keyboard keys instead
  so that you're independent of a particular keyboard:
  1) Start/end of a line ~C-a~ and ~C-e~
  2) Start/end of a buffer ~M-<~ and ~M->~
  3) Up/down/fwd/bwd with ~C-p~, ~C-n~, ~C-f~ and ~C-b~
  4) PgUp/PgDown with ~C-v~ and ~M-v~

- [L252] Interrupting commands with ~C-g~, and redoing steps with ~C-x u~
  or ~C-/~. To redo N steps: ~C-u N C-/~.

- [L345] Instead of the ~DEL~ key, use ~C-d~. Standard is that text is
  inserted at (cursor) point but you can change that with ~M-x
  overwrite-mode~ (toggles).

- [L410] What's the difference between "killing" and "deleting"?

[fn:1]"The Dunning-Kruger effect was first discovered and written
about in 1999, by researchers David Dunning and Justin Kruger at
Cornell University. The researchers spotted how much people
overestimated their own abilities in daily life—think of the guy in
class who keeps raising his hand to relay his useless ideas—and coined
the term “dual burden”. Dual burden was used to describe that these
people suffer from two things: ignorance, and ignorance of their own
ignorance. The researchers tested random participants on tests of
humour, grammar, and logical reasoning. They found that people who
ranked in the bottom 25% of any of these test scores tended to predict
themselves to be at the top of the pack. When they scored in the 12th
percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. On the flip
side, people in the top 25% predicted their scores to be slightly
lower than they actually were." (Source: [[https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect][thedecisionlab.com]])
