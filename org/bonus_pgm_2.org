* Problem

1) Modify the program that converted three specific height values from
   meters to light-years to compute the light-year equivalent of any
   height value in meters passed to the program as input.

2) Enter the three heights from the first program as test cases as
   *command line input*. To do this in Emacs, use the ~:cmdline < input~
   header argument.

* Submission

Submit your solution as an Emacs Org-mode file including the usual
header information (title, author, pledged), in Canvas.

The solution should contain the output after the code block.

#+begin_example
  : A height of 1.80 m is equivalent to 1.9039e-16 light-years
#+end_example
