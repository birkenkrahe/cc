- All course requirements have deadlines
- Late submissions will be penalized (loss of points)
- Final exam will be sourced by term test questions
- Programming assignments are home assignments
- In-class practices are "literate programming" exercises

- You find the invitation link to the group for Spring 23 [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1041/pages/course-links][in Canvas]].
- You will automatically be subscribed to the Digital Humanities team
- If you are in more than one course, I will add you later manually
- These accounts will be valid until July 8, 2023 only

* What is GitHub?

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe][GitHub]] is the most popular software development platform.

- It's now owned by Microsoft (which is becoming a problem)

- Here for you: all course materials, and the course FAQ

* NEXT When is the first assignment due?

[[../img/0_test.jpg]]

- The first DataCamp home assignment is due on January 20. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)

- The first in-class assignment is due on January 20. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)
  
- We'll write the first weekly multiple-choice test on January 20,
  covering all of the material that was covered until then.

* What should we do as a project?

[[../img/0_chatgpt.png]]

- For your term project, *pick an R package* to explore and explain
- The exploration should include *examples and tests*
- Your final deliverable should be a *literate program* (Org-mode)
- The final presentation should include *exercises* for the audience
- We can only accommodate *four (4) projects* altogether
- You need to deliver:
  a proposal, a literature review, an abstract

* What are you looking forward to?
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+attr_latex: :width 250px

- Developing lectures and exercises away from DataCamp
- Learning more about R packages through your projects
- Having fun with R programming and real applications

[fn:1]Maps and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are super cool but
deserve an introductory course on their own. The focus of my teaching
is to get you practical experience that you can use on the job instead
of a broad conceptual overview (though the latter would be easier for
all of us).
