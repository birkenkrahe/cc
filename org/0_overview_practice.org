Let's set Emacs up, write and run a first "literate" C program!

1) Open the command line terminal with ~CMD~ in the search field

2) At the prompt, type ~gcc --version~

3) Open https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/ in a browser

4) Navigate to the repository ~emacs~ in GitHub

5) Click on the file name ~.emacs~ to open it

6) Open the ~Raw~ version of this file (there's a button)

7) Right click to ~Save as~ and save file as ~emacs.txt~ in ~/Downloads~

8) Open a terminal by entering ~CMD~ in the Windows search bar

9) Pin the terminal to your taskbar

10) At the prompt, enter ~DIR emacs.txt~ - you should see the file

11) At the prompt, enter ~emacs --version~

12) Enter ~emacs -nw -l emacs.txt~

13) Inside Emacs, click ~<F10>~ and ~ENTER~ to open a new file

14) At the prompt at the bottom of the screen, enter ~first.org~

15) Enter the following text (replace ~yourname~ with your own name):
    #+attr_latex: :width 400px
    [[../img/0_first.png]]

16) Run the program by putting the cursor anywhere on the code block
    and typing ~CTRL-c CTRL-c~ (or ~C-c C-c~)

17) Tangle the code with ~C-c C-v t~ (or ~M-x org-babel-tangle~)

18) Open a shell (terminal program) with ~ALT-x eshell~

19) At the prompt, enter ~ls -l first*~ - you should see ~first.C~

20) Enter ~gcc first.C -o hello~

21) Enter ~hello~ to run the program.

22) Upload ~first.org~ as your first in-class assignment [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1041/assignments/5889][to Canvas!]]

* Home Assignment: Emacs tutorial (due Jan 23)

1) Open Emacs from the terminal application with ~emacs -nw~

2) Open the Emacs tutorial (link on start page, or ~C-h t~)

3) Complete the Emacs tutorial (start in class)

4) Insert these two lines at the top of the buffer:
   #+begin_example
     STUDENT: YourName [PLEDGED]
     Time-stamp: <>
   #+end_example

5) Remember that *"Pledged"* means that you have actually completed the
   tutorial along the lines of the instructions and in good faith as
   laid out in the [[https://catalog.lyon.edu/the-lyon-college-honor-pledge][Lyon College Honor Pledge]].

6) While visiting the buffer, insert a time stamp with the command ~M-x
   time-stamp~. Save the file with ~C-x C-w~ as a file ~tutorial.txt~ file
   and submit it in Canvas. The top of the submission should look like
   this (with your name and your time stamp, not mine - the added text
   was marked in red by me):
